#README: Comparison of CSTR and PFR Volumes for First-Order Reactions

Overview
This project provides a Streamlit web application that compares the CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor) and PFR (Plug Flow Reactor) volumes required to achieve a specified conversion for first-order reactions. The app allows users to input the reaction rate constant (k), flow rate (F), and target conversion (X), and it visualizes the volume comparison between CSTR and PFR over a range of conversion values.

Key Features:

CSTR and PFR Volume Calculations: The app computes and displays the reactor volumes for a first-order reaction given user inputs.
Interactive Sliders: Users can adjust the rate constant, flow rate, and target conversion dynamically.
Volume Plot: A line plot shows how the required reactor volumes vary with conversion for both CSTR and PFR.

#README: McCabe-Thiele Distillation Column Calculator

Overview

This project provides a Streamlit web application that allows users to visualize a McCabe-Thiele diagram for a distillation column. The app takes key distillation parameters such as relative volatility (Î±), feed mole fraction (xF), distillate mole fraction (xD), bottoms mole fraction (xB), reflux ratio (R), and feed condition (q) as inputs, and generates a plot of the equilibrium curve and the operating lines for the rectifying and stripping sections of the distillation column.

Key Features:

Equilibrium Curve: Based on the relative volatility and feed composition.
Rectifying and Stripping Lines: Calculated based on the reflux ratio, feed condition, and product compositions.
Interactive Sliders and Inputs: Users can dynamically adjust distillation parameters and see real-time changes in the McCabe-Thiele diagram.
Graphical Output: A McCabe-Thiele diagram is generated, showing the intersection of operating lines and the equilibrium curve, which helps in analyzing the number of theoretical stages for separation.

#README: Liquid-Liquid Extraction: Tie-Line Diagram

Overview

This project presents a Streamlit web application that visualizes the distribution of a solute between two immiscible phases (aqueous and organic) in a liquid-liquid extraction process. The application allows users to input initial solute concentrations and the distribution ratio to generate a tie-line diagram, illustrating how the solute partitions between the two phases.

Key Features:

Interactive Input: Users can specify the initial solute concentration in the aqueous phase and the distribution ratio.
Tie-Line Diagram: The application generates a tie-line diagram that displays the relationship between solute concentrations in the aqueous and organic phases.
Calculated Outputs: The app computes and displays the solute concentration in the organic phase based on the user-defined inputs.

#README: Wastewater Treatment Dissolved Oxygen Profile Simulator

Overview

This project provides a Streamlit web application designed to simulate the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration over time in an aeration tank during wastewater treatment. The app allows users to input various parameters related to oxygen transfer efficiency and consumption rates, enabling them to visualize the dynamics of oxygen levels critical for effective microbial activity in the treatment process.

Key Features:

Interactive User Input: Users can adjust key parameters, including oxygen transfer efficiency, oxygen consumption rate, and initial dissolved oxygen levels.
Dynamic Visualization: The application generates a plot showing how the dissolved oxygen concentration changes over time.
Threshold Indicator: A minimum DO threshold line is plotted to highlight critical levels necessary for effective microbial activity.

#README: Budgeting App

Overview

This project provides a Streamlit web application for household budgeting. The app allows users to input their income and expenses, calculate total income, total expenses, and net savings, and visualize the budget distribution using a pie chart.

Key Features:

Income Input: Users can enter various sources of income including salary, investment income, and other income.
Expenses Input: Users can detail their expenses across various categories such as housing, utilities, groceries, and entertainment.
Net Savings Calculation: The app calculates and displays net savings or deficits based on the user inputs.
Visual Representation: The budget distribution is displayed in a pie chart, showing the proportion of each expense category.
